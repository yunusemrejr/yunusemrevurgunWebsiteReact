This React app was created to replace my previous personal blog's interface.
There are some configurations needed to be smoothly implemented on an Apache server.


Resources used during development:

https://react.dev/ (for fundemental implementations and conceptual understanding of elements)
https://bard.google.com/ (for exploration and searching purposes, mostly error-finding and explanations with up-to-date data from web for suitable library versions and valid built-in functions that won't cause integration errors)
https://openai.com/chatgpt (for learning and guidence on steps to follow during development, mostly folder structures, best practices and syntax)
https://youtu.be/uTofiLVM3mg (for Apache server integration)
